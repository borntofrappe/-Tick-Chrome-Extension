# \`Tick\` Chrome Extension

A chrome extension to display the blue outline of a working clock on a dark background. Materialize said clock by clicking the icon for the chrome extension, or by opening a new tab.

## Preace

Currently, the simple application is not published in the Chrome Store. For the time being, that will remain the case, as it doesn't really solve any purpose beside allowing me to practice with creating a React Application and include the code behind said application in a chrom extension.

You can get a general idea of what the extension will look like by checking out this [pen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/wXGKpg).

## How to Use

Acknoweleding the preface, you can still download this repository and use the extension in the chrome developer section, as here briefly instructed. 

1. download the repository;

1. unzip the downloaded file;

1. go to the extension section on chrome, on `chrome://extensions/`;

1. select _load unpacked_;

1. select in the newfound menu the _build_ folder 

And that's pretty much it. 

You should now be able to see the nice-looking clock by clicking on the clock icon in the extension bar or by opening a new tab.
Neat.
